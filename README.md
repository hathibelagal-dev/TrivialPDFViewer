# TrivialPDFViewer

This is a very simple PDF viewer created using the [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/) library and viewer. In addition to loading and rendering a page from a PDF, this code clearly shows how to use the new `PDFLinkService` and `AnnotationLayer` classes to add annotations(just clickable links, fow now) to your page.

The entire code is in one HTML document for easy readability. Feel free to create issues and PRs if you want to extend the scope/functionality of this little PDF viewer.
